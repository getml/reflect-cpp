## About the data

The information shown above is updated monthly using the Github GraphQL API.

You can find the source code for generating this data [here](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp/tree/main/.github/actions/people/people.py). The code is borrowed from the [pydantic project](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/main/.github/actions/people/people.py), and modified to work with the reflect-cpp repository. Originally, the logic comes from [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/master/.github/actions/people/app/main.py).
